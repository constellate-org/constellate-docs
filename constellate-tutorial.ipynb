    " - Constellate sees a Markdown cell followed by a Python cell that produces a static image as output, and it further sees that you import `matplotlib`.\n",

    "   - The theme has matching light and dark versions, so toggling the dark theme will change the plot to match.[^1]\n",
    "   - There are sister themes for other common Python visualization libraries, so mixing `matplotlib` and `bokeh` plots will maintain a single visual style.\n",
    "   - Referring to colors used in a plot is fairly common, and doing that with dark mode support requires Constellate knowing what those colors are. Note how I use `<span color='text-c1'>normal</span>` to make <span color='text-c1'>normal</span> colored to match the color used in the plot, in both light and dark mode. There's more on this in the user guide.\n",
    " - Constellate, as noted above, then runs the cell twice: once to generate a light-mode version, and once to generate a dark-mode version. These are then saved as images and included in the processed `getting-started.constellate` file used to inform the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Note how the hues used are in the same order: a dark blue in the light theme becomes a light blue in the dark theme, so you can still talk about \"the blue line\" and make sense."
